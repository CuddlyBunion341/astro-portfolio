# TSMC2

This is probably the project I spent most of my free time on. There have been many iterations:

1. Minecraft Clone: Simple infinite terrain, hacky, chaotic code written in JavaScript
2. TSMC: A rewrite of Minecraft Clone in TypeScript, better code structure, functional hotbar, water, sand physics, hacky collisions
3. TMSC2: A more sophisticated codebase in TypeScript, multithreading with Webworkers, custom shaders with GLSL, better defined workflow with Pull Requests, attempt at integrating rust with WASM to improve terrain generation performance.
4. RSMC: A Minecraft clone written entirely in Rust, in a very early stage with focus on Multiplayer and performance.
